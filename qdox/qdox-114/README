Description
===========

QDox does not properly parse the < and > operators after encountering a
'new block'. For example, the following code snippets do not parse:

        int a[] = new int[1 << 16];

or

        Object o = new Object();
        int a = 1 << 30;

This patch updates the lexer to properly account for these situations.
In the first scenario we need to recognize that we are within an array
intializer and thus not descend our nesting too far. The second scenario
simply requires us to reset our state when we encounter a ';', namely we
are no longer in a 'new block'.
