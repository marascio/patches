Patch the mongrel_cluster recipes distributed with the Palmtree
Capistrano recipes gem (http://rubyforge.org/projects/palmtree) to
provide a configuration option for specifying mongrel_rails -S command
line option.

This patch adds a new configuration option, :mongrel_conf_script, that
can be set in your Capistrano recipe, for example: 

    set :mongrel_conf_script, "#{deploy_to}/current/config/mongrel.conf"

If this is set when you run the mongrel:cluster:configure task the
generated mongrel_cluster.yml will contain a line similiar to:

    config_script: /var/www/app/current/config/mongrel.conf

Where, of course, #{mongrel_conf_script} contains the text specified in
your Capistrano recipe.
